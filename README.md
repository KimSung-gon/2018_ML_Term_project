I tried to track the rc_car on the webcam attached on TX2 board.

I used darknet yolo network.
Darknet link : https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet                                                                             
Using Yolo tiny v2 network to make real time system.
It about 17fps close to real time(20fps).                                                                                       
The Yolo tiny v2 network has 16 layer to make fast.
And I used Yolo_mark to mark the location of rc_car.
